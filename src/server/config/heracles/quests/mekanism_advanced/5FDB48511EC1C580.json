      "So how can we prevent such a catastrophic disaster? By creating a redstone &&aCircuit Breaker&&r using &&dFission Reactor Logic Adapters&&r. Now these aren't 100% guaranteed to stop an explosion, but they are absolutely nice to have.",

      "Essentially, these Adapters allow us to control the Reactor using &&cRedstone&&r. With just one, you can use a lever to turn on and off the reactor. However, we're going to use them for damage control.",

      "You can also set these to give off a Redstone Signal based on a certain condition within the Reactor, like &&cDamage Critical&&r or &&8Insufficient Fuel&&r. This is useful for setting up a circuit breaker to shut off the Reactor if those ever happen.",
